# hexWriter
This program takes a file name or path as an input and writes the hex data inside it to a file as actual bytes
Here is an example of how the File needs to be formatted:\
0x45, 0x27, 0xff, 0x4c


Anything that is not a valid character will be ignored except commas.
commas are used to seperate each hex number.
